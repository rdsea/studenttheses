## AaltoSEA Thesis Principles and Procedure

### Principles for Bachelor Theses

- Each topic is big enough to allow 2-3 students carried out the thesis work
- The topic could be last for a year 
- Within a topic, individuals can do a specific threat of work, each topic will be advised by an advisor and mostly aligned with the advisor research direction 
- The head of AaltoSEA - Linh Truong - will oversee the quality but not act as the advisor for postdocs/PhD students offering the topic 
- All students are required to meet and report the progress of the work in Aalto thesis meetings
   - If a student does not commit to the schedule due to the lack of time or other reasons, we suggest the student should not take the topic from our group.
  
In the first meeting, we will clarify the protocol. 

### Quality control in writing

We suggest students to write a story like what could be found in seminar/conference/journal paper. Students should also try to do some qualitative/quantitative 
work to have better understanding and discussion (avoid just reading the papers, although the thesis does not require design or implementation work) 

A bachelor thesis is 10 credits = 270 hours, thus we suggest:

- 40 hours to really scope and understand the scope of the work
- 40 hours to identify all relevant documents/sources (initial)

Thus we ask students to outline how many hours they plan per week for us to make two checkpoints: scoping and initial sources. Without passing that two checkpoints, the change the thesis fails is quite high.
