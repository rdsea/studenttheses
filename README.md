## AaltoSEA Thesis Principles and Procedure

### Principles for Bachelor Theses

- Each topic is big enough to allow 2-3 students carried out the thesis work
- The topic could be last for a year 
- Within a topic, individuals can do a specific threat of work, each topic will be advised by an advisor and mostly aligned with the advisor research direction 
- The head of AaltoSEA - Linh Truong - will oversee the quality but not act as the advisor for postdocs/PhD students offering the topic 
- All students are required to meet and report the progress of the work in Aalto thesis meetings
   - If a student does not commit to the schedule due to the lack of time or other reasons, we suggest the student should not take the topic from our group.
  
In the first meeting, we will clarify the protocol. 

### Quality control in writing

We suggest students to write a story like what could be found in seminar/conference/journal paper. Students should also try to do some qualitative/quantitative 
work to have better understanding and discussion (avoid just reading the papers, although the thesis does not require design or implementation work) 

A bachelor thesis is 10 credits = 270 hours, thus we suggest:

- 40 hours to really scope and understand the scope of the work
- 40 hours to identify all relevant documents/sources (initial)

Thus we ask students to outline how many hours they plan per week for us to make two checkpoints: scoping and initial sources. Without passing that two checkpoints, the change the thesis fails is quite high.


## List of Available Topics for Bachelor Theses

### Bachelor Thesis Meetings

**All students who take the thesis topics from AaltoSEA will have to join regular thesis meetings**
> Thu, 11am-12pm, Konemiehentie 2, B322
> The first meeting: 08.09.2025. Then we will design the follow ups.

### Fall, 2025

#### Topic: Quality of Analytics for Data/AI-intensive Applications and Systems 

>**Background**:  

The concept of QoA recommends to characterize, monitor and optimize cloud applications, data pipelines, ML training/inferences, etc based on multiple dimensional metrics associated with data, performance, AI/ML, etc.  

As data- and AI-intensive services and systems evolve due to complex workloads and requirements, as the same time, new hardware and infrastructures emerge, metrics and techniques must be evolved.  

The work is to review/survey QoA metrics, techniques and tools. Within this topic, specific areas can be studied, such as (i) emerging metrics and measurements for AI Agents/Agentic AI, (ii) optimization based on QoA, (iii) tools for new metrics and infrastructures, e.g., related to the memory and low-latency communications with RDMA, and CXL fabrics.

#### Topic: Opportunistic Data Operation Platforms 
 
>**Background**: 
 Advanced applications leverage heterogeneous computing resources for diverse types of tasks. To date computing resources can be complex sets of GPU and CPU, whereas underlying communications and memory fabrics are also heterogenous, such as hardware acceleration for communications, RDMA, CLX, multi-endpoint smart NIC nodes, etc. At the same time, applications have different types of tasks with different workloads. Applications have services and tasks deployed in multi facilities of edge, cloud and HPC. Even a small fraction of unused allocated resources could be useful for some opportunistic operations. The topic will examine possible solutions to support opportunistic data operations, in terms of monitoring, scheduling, or profiling applications. The topic will also examine concrete techniques for specific infrastructures, such as multi-tenant environments in clouds and HPC with intra- and inter-node opportunistic operations.  Students will focus only on one specific aspect of the topic.
